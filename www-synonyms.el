;;; Commentary:

;; Lookup and insert synonyms for many different languages
;; Key for lookup authentication is needed: you can get it here: http://thesaurus.altervista.org/mykey
;; Internet connection is required
;; There are more packages for synonyms.  Why should I use this one?
;; More languages than other packages are supported at this time:
;;  - english (uk and us)
;;  - german
;;  - italian
;;  - french
;;  - spanish
;;  - russian
;;  - norwegian
;;  - portuguese
;;  - slovakian
;;  - romanian
;; Why should I use another one?
;; A stable internet connection is required
